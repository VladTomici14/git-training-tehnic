# Web Fundamentals Demo

This mini project highlights the essential building blocks of modern web development using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Structure

- `index.html` – semantic layout with header, main content, and footer
- `styles.css` – responsive styling and simple design system
- `script.js` – small interactive example toggling a highlight state

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Click the **Toggle Highlight** button to see the JavaScript interaction.

Feel free to expand on this project by adding new sections, components, or scripts to explore more web concepts.
